 * TS-SS similarity is a metric that ranges between 0 and 1, where 1 means the two row vectors are identical.
 * The lower the TS-SS similarity value, the less similar the two row vectors are.
 * A value of -1 indicates an error has occurred.
 * TS-SS similarity is calculated using the following formula:
 * 1 - (TSSS distance between m1 and m2) / sqrt(n * var_m1 * var_m2),
 * where var_m1 and var_m2 are the variances of m1 and m2, respectively.
 * The TSSS distance between two row vectors is the Euclidean distance between their normalized values.
 * The normalization is done by dividing each element in a row vector by the square root of the variance of that row vector.
 * The Euclidean distance is the square root of the sum of the squared differences between corresponding elements in the two row vectors.
 * The larger the TSSS distance, the less similar the two row vectors are.
 * The square root in the denominator of the TS-SS similarity formula ensures that the metric is scaled properly.
 * The smaller the TS-SS similarity value, the less similar the two row vectors are.
